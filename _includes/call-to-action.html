					Problems? Solved. Bugs? Fixed. Coronavirus? Cured. That's right.
					If you get Joshua now within 24 hours, maybe you'll get this package and even more!<br>
					
					Okay, maybe that was an overexaggeration. However, Joshua does truly love problem solving,
					programming in many languages (e.g. C++, C#, and Python), and creating personal electrical and
					software projects.<br>
					
					As a software developer with 3 years of professional experience, a Bachelor's degree in EE with a 
					speciailization in machine learning, and an upcoming Master's degree in ML, Joshua is 
					constantly challenging himself to learn new cutting-edge and creative engineering concepts. He has
					worked on full stack dev, iSCSI network dev, CI/CD/CT pipelines, camera software tool dev, 
					3A image QA testing, many electrical/mechanical project dev, and much more. You can find more details
					in the sections below.<br>
					
					Joshua also loves to learn new, creative things. So when he isn't coding, you'll find him breakdancing; 
					drawing; playing cello, guitar, or electric bass; cooking; gaming; and more. You can look below to see some 
					of his passions in action!
